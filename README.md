Backend work done during my internship at CaterNinja (July 2023 - Sept 2023), I undertook backend development tasks. This included the creation of a robust CRUD application tailored for the product team's needs. The application allows users to generate new product types, and incorporate them into the menu in diverse configurations. Additionally, users have the capability to modify or remove products and create custom combinations, all of which can be viewed in a tabular form.
This repository contains the codebase for this project.
